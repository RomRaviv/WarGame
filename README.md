# FIFA War Game

This is an innovative card game iOS application developed in SwiftUI. The game concept is based on the classic game of War, but with a twist: instead of traditional playing cards, the game uses FIFA player cards. These cards are modeled after real-world football players, with each card's value determined by the player's overall score in the FIFA game. The game pits two players, a user and a computer, in a head-to-head competition where they flip cards and compare their values. The player with the higher card value earns a point. The game continues for ten rounds, after which the final scores are displayed, and a winner is declared.

## Features

### User Name Entry

The app allows the user to enter their name or use a previously saved name. An alert is presented where the user can enter their name. The name must consist of alphabetic characters only and cannot be empty. The app saves the user's name using UserDefaults for future sessions.

### Player Cards

Each card in the game represents a real-world FIFA player. The card's value is determined by the player's overall score in the FIFA game. The app's database contains hundreds of cards, ensuring a diverse gameplay experience.

### Scoring and Winning

The game continues for ten rounds, with each round consisting of the user and the computer flipping a card. The player with the higher card value (based on the FIFA player's overall score) earns a point. After ten rounds, the game displays the final scores and declares a winner. If there's a tie, the game continues with sudden death rounds until a winner emerges.

### Player Position

The game displays an image indicating the left or right side of the default location from the current location, determining the player's position in the game.
